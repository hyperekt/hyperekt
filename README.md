### I'm *probably* epidem7c.
I'll probably be inactive, but because of the gods of GitHub, I present you my shopping list.

- I'm currently working on: a supreme JavaScript randomizer and a website: http://epidem7c.epizy.com/
- I'm currently learning: how to code. In general.
- I'm looking to collaborate on: no.
- Fun fact: the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.
